Search engines think it’s frustrating as well. They don’t hesitate to make your page suffer for having that error. As simple as these solutions might be, it isn’t always easy to notice them. Using a tool like <a href=\"https://seranking.com/\"><span>SERanking</span></a> can immediately identify broken links and show you what to look for when search engines are indexing your content. Similarly to identifying dead links in your SEO Content, linking related posts will help as well. We all get our information from somewhere, but if the backlink you are creating is not relevant to your topic then you have decreased the validity of the content in the search engines eyes. An easy way to avoid this issue is using keywords as a guide to finding SEO Content similar to your own. Now the further you search, the higher the probability that information may not be recent, relevant or helpful to your goal. It may take a little getting used to, but finding <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31388/how-to-use-internal-linking-to-improve-your-website-s-seo.aspx\"><span>high quality sources</span></a> to backlink will pay off in the long run.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Meta Descriptions and Image Alt Tags in your SEO Content</h2>\n<p>Meta Descriptions are a preview of the contents on your webpage or blog. Having this helps quickly inform the consumer what will be covered on that page. Image Alt Tags serve a similar purpose to the overall health of these pages. The alt tags provide insight to the search engine for what the picture you are uploading will contain. In these situations it should include keywords or long-tail keywords you are attempting to rank that are the same as the topic of your page. These <a href=\"https://blog.artscube.biz/performing-on-page-seo\"><span>strong tools</span></a> can be utilized in your SEO Content. Providing the search engine consistent information will help it index your content and improve the overall quality and health of your page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Contact Art’s Cube&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Not sure where to get started with your SEO journey?

Search engines think it’s frustrating as well. They don’t hesitate to make your page suffer for having that error. As simple as these solutions might be, it isn’t always easy to notice them. Using a tool like <a href=\"https://seranking.com/\"><span>SERanking</span></a> can immediately identify broken links and show you what to look for when search engines are indexing your content. Similarly to identifying dead links in your SEO Content, linking related posts will help as well. We all get our information from somewhere, but if the backlink you are creating is not relevant to your topic then you have decreased the validity of the content in the search engines eyes. An easy way to avoid this issue is using keywords as a guide to finding SEO Content similar to your own. Now the further you search, the higher the probability that information may not be recent, relevant or helpful to your goal. It may take a little getting used to, but finding <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/31388/how-to-use-internal-linking-to-improve-your-website-s-seo.aspx\"><span>high quality sources</span></a> to backlink will pay off in the long run.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Meta Descriptions and Image Alt Tags in your SEO Content</h2>\n<p>Meta Descriptions are a preview of the contents on your webpage or blog. Having this helps quickly inform the consumer what will be covered on that page. Image Alt Tags serve a similar purpose to the overall health of these pages. The alt tags provide insight to the search engine for what the picture you are uploading will contain. In these situations it should include keywords or long-tail keywords you are attempting to rank that are the same as the topic of your page. These <a href=\"https://blog.artscube.biz/performing-on-page-seo\"><span>strong tools</span></a> can be utilized in your SEO Content. Providing the search engine consistent information will help it index your content and improve the overall quality and health of your page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Contact Art’s Cube&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>Not sure where to get started with your SEO journey?

Over the last five years, the global internet community has made it increasingly clear that video content is the preferred method of consumption for media across the board.

So what is the ideal format? Well, it depends on the goal of the marketing message, and this is what makes short-term video content so powerful, its versatility.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Styles of Short Form Video Content</h2>\n<p>The second biggest strength of short form video content is its versatility. Short form video content can be used by brands of any size and in any sector and can accomplish a wide variety of marketing objectives. From informative videos to promotions to testimonials, short form video is a perfect format to spread brand awareness and create memorable content.</p>\n<p>Choosing a style is heavily dependent on the objective of the marketing message; once the style is determined, the length of the video is much easier to determine. Here are some of the latest short form video trends that have been creating a buzz across social media:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<h2>Behind the Brand Content</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Fairly self-explanatory, behind-the-brand content gives the consumer an in-depth look at the different processes that make a brand function. This can be informative or casual, but the main goal is to instill trust and transparency with the consumer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>Product Teasers</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">A short form video is perfectly tailored to the concept of a product teaser. Conceptually similar to the infomercials of the early nineties, product teasers are informative videos that build anticipation or reveal new products or services for a brand. The significant advantage of short form videos versus commercials is that they require minimal budget and production. In addition, due to their short nature, they offer a creative space for attention grabbers and flashy graphics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>Influencer Ads</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Influencer ads have penetrated just about every social media platform, resulting in an influx of reach for brands that may not have previously had the budget. It is a win-win situation when it comes to short form video and influencer marketing. Influencers are provided with a new creative outlet for their content, and brands can promote their products and services in a more creative fashion than your typical ad read or sponsored video.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>Brand Challenges</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Speaking of influencers, brand challenges have been wildly successful over the last five years since the viral ALS ice bucket challenge in 2014. For example, Netflix’s #What’s YourPower challenge is a series of short videos where viewers and influencers showcase their “superpowers” with the hashtag. This brand challenge campaign garnered over 6.3 billion views across Tik Tok alone.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>UGC (User Generated Content)</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Another one of short form video’s most potent tools is UGC or user-generated content. Similar to brand challenges but substantially more flexible, UGC can be used to raise money for charity, inform users of a new product, or build brand awareness with the ability to go viral organically. UGC can be tailored to suit nearly any marketing objective.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Why is Short Form Video So Successful</h2>\n<p>Short form video derives alot of its success from its “snackable size.” With each platform allowing a different maximum time, it can be hard to determine the length of the video, but the choice of content style will help guide your decision-making. Typically a limit of 60 seconds is recommended as 68% of people will happily watch a business video if it’s under a minute, and on average, 66% of video ads are less than 30 seconds. (<a href=\"https://extremereach.com/blog/video-ad-serving-benchmarks/\">Extreme Reach</a>). Additionally, the ability of short form videos to be shared and go viral lends itself greatly to brands trying to spread awareness while on a budget.

Take a look at some of Tik Tok’s most significant competitors; Meta has rolled out Reels on their platform Instagram, and Youtube debuted Youtube Shorts; even Google and LinkedIn are getting into the mix with their own takes on short-form video content. In this blog, we will examine some key performance indicators associated with this new short-form strategy and seek to understand the drivers behind so many brands adopting this strategy so quickly.</p>\n<!--more--><h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Short Form Video Engagement</h2>\n<p>The bread and butter of short form video are the insane engagement metrics. Over the last five years, the global internet community has made it increasingly clear that video content is the preferred method of consumption for media across the board. According to a study performed by <a href=\"https://www.colormatics.com/article/short-form-video-statistics-and-2020-marketing-trends/\">Colormatics</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Video content on social media receives 48% more views on social media</li>\n<li>Video Content on Instagram Receives 49% Higher Engagement Rates</li>\n<li>72% of People Prefer Video vs. Text to Learn a New Product or Service.</li>\n<li>60% of Internet Traffic Revolves Around Video</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So clearly, the people have spoken, when it comes to consuming a brand’s content, they want it in an easily digestible video format. So what is the ideal format? Well, it depends on the goal of the marketing message, and this is what makes short-term video content so powerful, its versatility.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Styles of Short Form Video Content</h2>\n<p>The second biggest strength of short form video content is its versatility. Short form video content can be used by brands of any size and in any sector and can accomplish a wide variety of marketing objectives. From informative videos to promotions to testimonials, short form video is a perfect format to spread brand awareness and create memorable content.</p>\n<p>Choosing a style is heavily dependent on the objective of the marketing message; once the style is determined, the length of the video is much easier to determine. Here are some of the latest short form video trends that have been creating a buzz across social media:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li>\n<h2>Behind the Brand Content</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Fairly self-explanatory, behind-the-brand content gives the consumer an in-depth look at the different processes that make a brand function. This can be informative or casual, but the main goal is to instill trust and transparency with the consumer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>Product Teasers</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">A short form video is perfectly tailored to the concept of a product teaser. Conceptually similar to the infomercials of the early nineties, product teasers are informative videos that build anticipation or reveal new products or services for a brand. The significant advantage of short form videos versus commercials is that they require minimal budget and production. In addition, due to their short nature, they offer a creative space for attention grabbers and flashy graphics.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>Influencer Ads</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Influencer ads have penetrated just about every social media platform, resulting in an influx of reach for brands that may not have previously had the budget. It is a win-win situation when it comes to short form video and influencer marketing. Influencers are provided with a new creative outlet for their content, and brands can promote their products and services in a more creative fashion than your typical ad read or sponsored video.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>Brand Challenges</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Speaking of influencers, brand challenges have been wildly successful over the last five years since the viral ALS ice bucket challenge in 2014. For example, Netflix’s #What’s YourPower challenge is a series of short videos where viewers and influencers showcase their “superpowers” with the hashtag. This brand challenge campaign garnered over 6.3 billion views across Tik Tok alone.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>UGC (User Generated Content)</h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Another one of short form video’s most potent tools is UGC or user-generated content. Similar to brand challenges but substantially more flexible, UGC can be used to raise money for charity, inform users of a new product, or build brand awareness with the ability to go viral organically. UGC can be tailored to suit nearly any marketing objective.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 32px;\">Why is Short Form Video So Successful</h2>\n<p>Short form video derives alot of its success from its “snackable size.” With each platform allowing a different maximum time, it can be hard to determine the length of the video, but the choice of content style will help guide your decision-making. Typically a limit of 60 seconds is recommended as 68% of people will happily watch a business video if it’s under a minute, and on average, 66% of video ads are less than 30 seconds.

Ads can be a great way to reach new customers and grow your business. However, if your campaigns are not optimized correctly, you may not be getting the most out of your investment. In this article, we will discuss three ways to optimize your Google Ads campaigns for better results.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>The primary network we will be discussing in this article is based on the search network but these practices can be applied to any of the networks.</p>\n<h2>Metics Analyzed To Make Optimizations</h2>\n<p>There are three primary <a href=\"/why-google-advertising-benefits-your-small-business\" rel=\"noopener\">metrics I focus on when optimizing Google Ads</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conversions - the number of purchases or sign-ups created from ads. (I.e. leads)</li>\n<li>Conversion Rate - the rate at which clicks are converted into conversions. This number is calculated by the conversions / number of clicks.</li>\n<li>Cost per Conversion - the average cost per conversion. This is calculated by the total cost over conversions / total number of conversions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason why I focus on these metrics is they get down to the bottom line for any business. If you can increase your conversions and increase your conversion rate, you more than likely are going to be decreasing your cost per conversion. The assumption made is that total ad cost stays the same</p>\n<h2>What Is The Right Data Set?</h2>\n<p>If you have only been running your <a href=\"https://marketing.artscube.biz/google-ads-ppc-management\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads campaign(s)</a> for a few weeks, you haven't necessarily accrued the proper amount of data to make the assumption that the locations targeted are preferred or non-preferred.</p>\n<p>Typically, looking at a three to six-month data set will give you a better picture of what is working and what is not working. If you can go further than six months or year-over-year data, your data set will give you a great picture and assumptions can be more accurate.</p>\n<h2>1. Optimize Targeted Locations</h2>\n<p>Depending on the product or service of the company you are advertising for you more than likely are focused on select markets. These markets can be radius-based or specific cities or regions.</p>\n<p>Get started by going to your selected campaign and on the left-hand side, go to Locations. Once you open this, you should see a screen that shows your performance metrics by the selected locations. If you are targeting specific locations, instead of radius targeting, you can select a specific location and drill down more by cities, neighborhoods, postal codes, and airports.</p>\n<p>The drill-down option I typically look at is the postal codes.</p>\n<p><span>When going through your targeted postal code locations, go through and sort by the metrics mentioned above, Conversions, Conversion Rate, and Cost/Conversions.</span></p>\n<h3>Here are the steps to deciding which areas to focus on:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span>If you see locations where you are getting clicks and not getting conversions, turn them off.</span></li>\n<li><span>If you see locations where you are getting low conversions, low conversion rate, and high cost per conversion - turn them off.<br><br></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Why advertise in an area where you are spending money and not making any?</em></p>\n<h2>2.

However, if your campaigns are not optimized correctly, you may not be getting the most out of your investment. In this article, we will discuss three ways to optimize your Google Ads campaigns for better results.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>The primary network we will be discussing in this article is based on the search network but these practices can be applied to any of the networks.</p>\n<h2>Metics Analyzed To Make Optimizations</h2>\n<p>There are three primary <a href=\"/why-google-advertising-benefits-your-small-business\" rel=\"noopener\">metrics I focus on when optimizing Google Ads</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conversions - the number of purchases or sign-ups created from ads. (I.e. leads)</li>\n<li>Conversion Rate - the rate at which clicks are converted into conversions. This number is calculated by the conversions / number of clicks.</li>\n<li>Cost per Conversion - the average cost per conversion. This is calculated by the total cost over conversions / total number of conversions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason why I focus on these metrics is they get down to the bottom line for any business. If you can increase your conversions and increase your conversion rate, you more than likely are going to be decreasing your cost per conversion. The assumption made is that total ad cost stays the same</p>\n<h2>What Is The Right Data Set?</h2>\n<p>If you have only been running your <a href=\"https://marketing.artscube.biz/google-ads-ppc-management\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Ads campaign(s)</a> for a few weeks, you haven't necessarily accrued the proper amount of data to make the assumption that the locations targeted are preferred or non-preferred.</p>\n<p>Typically, looking at a three to six-month data set will give you a better picture of what is working and what is not working. If you can go further than six months or year-over-year data, your data set will give you a great picture and assumptions can be more accurate.</p>\n<h2>1. Optimize Targeted Locations</h2>\n<p>Depending on the product or service of the company you are advertising for you more than likely are focused on select markets. These markets can be radius-based or specific cities or regions.</p>\n<p>Get started by going to your selected campaign and on the left-hand side, go to Locations. Once you open this, you should see a screen that shows your performance metrics by the selected locations. If you are targeting specific locations, instead of radius targeting, you can select a specific location and drill down more by cities, neighborhoods, postal codes, and airports.</p>\n<p>The drill-down option I typically look at is the postal codes.</p>\n<p><span>When going through your targeted postal code locations, go through and sort by the metrics mentioned above, Conversions, Conversion Rate, and Cost/Conversions.</span></p>\n<h3>Here are the steps to deciding which areas to focus on:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span>If you see locations where you are getting clicks and not getting conversions, turn them off.</span></li>\n<li><span>If you see locations where you are getting low conversions, low conversion rate, and high cost per conversion - turn them off.<br><br></span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Why advertise in an area where you are spending money and not making any?</em></p>\n<h2>2. Optimize For Day And Time Of Day</h2>\n<p>Let's make the assumption that you are offering a B2B service and after doing some keyword searches, you know that the terms you are focused on are not highly searched after business hours. You more than likely are going to only advertise when people are searching.</p>\n<p>We will go through this process looking at the same metrics we analyzed above but looking at the days and times of day when ads are running.</p>\n<p>You can look at multiple different views when analyzing the times where you are getting the best traffic that is converting into leads by going to the ad schedule on the left-hand side of your Google Ads performance screen.</p>\n<h3>What are the different views?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Day &amp; hour - shows you the day and hours for selected metrics</li>\n<li>Day - shows you the day for selected metrics</li>\n<li>Hour - shows the hour(s) for selected metrics</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The view that shows the data set that will give you the best assumptions for analyzing ad performance is the Day &amp; hour view. Here you can see what day and what time where your ad dollars are spent efficiently.</p>\n<h3>Here are the steps to deciding which areas to focus on:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If you see days and times of day where you are getting clicks and not getting conversions, turn those times off.</li>\n<li>If you see days and times of day where you are getting low conversions, low conversion rate, and high cost per conversion, turn those times off.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have an ad schedule that runs from 08:00 to 17:00, you are going to want to optimize your ad schedule by adding multiple times of the day to run ads and excluding times where you do not want to advertise.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Note: you can only at six (6) time slots per day, so pick wisely.</p>\n<p><em>Why advertise during times when you are not generating leads?</em></p>\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>These two simple steps can make a big impact on your bottom dollar, and as a marketer, you will take pride in presenting better performance metrics to your higher-ups.</p>\n<p>Remember that your data set matters!</p>\n<p>If you can view your data set for a longer set of time, you'll be able to make better assumptions and make better optimizations for your Google Ads campaigns.</p>\n<p>Art's Cube has been managing Google Ads campaigns for almost a decade now and provides transparent reporting for your ROI.

This technique on of <a href=\"/what-is-seo-and-how-it-works\" rel=\"noopener\">many parts of search engine optimization</a> that takes place on the page itself, as opposed to off-site factors, technical SEO, link building, and content marketing.</p>\n<p>Understanding what the topic covered on each webpage of your website is not only important for your visitors but for search engines, like Google, as well.</p>\n<p>Performing site-wide SEO can be tough for newbies, but going page by page and running reports on platforms like <a href=\"https://seranking.com\" rel=\"noopener\">SeRanking</a> or SEMRush can help guide you in making small changes that can ultimately increase your site's reach for your targeted keywords.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">On-page SEO techniques to increase organic traffic</h2>\n<p>On-page SEO techniques are important for increasing organic traffic to your website. By optimizing each individual website page with on-page SEO best practices, you can make it easier for search engines to find and rank your site. Here are some easy techniques:</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Updating the title of the page</h3>\n<p>The title of your webpage is one of the most important on-page SEO factors. It is the first thing search engines see when crawling your website, and it is also what potential visitors will see in search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>\n<p>When performing a Google search for the keyword shredding services, you will find paid results and organic results. The paid results are at the top and have \"AD\" beside each result. The organic results are below the paid and will look something like the image below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://4292583.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/4292583/undefined-1.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\"></p>\n<p>Highlighted in red, we see the title of the page \"Carolina Shred | Shredding Services\". Note the keyword shredding services in the title of the page.</p>\n<p>If you have a page with the focus topic of \"One Time Shredding Service\" you should have that in the title of the page. Including the focus keyword is critical in helping Google and your visitors understand the page.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Optimizing your meta description</h3>\n<p>The meta description is a brief overview of the contents hosted on that specific page. Including your focus keyword within the body of the description helps the SERPs and visitors have a deeper understanding of what the page covers.</p>\n<p>The meta description can be found below the title of the page when performing a Google search.

However, in order to tap into email’s true potential, several best practices must be followed. This week’s blog will serve as a stepping stone to launching targeted, valuable content to your current subscribers.</p>\n<!--more--><p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">List Segmentation</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While seemingly simple, list segmentation is one of the most critical steps to creating an effective marketing email. Segmentation is what helps focus your email content as well as ensure that the right information is going to the correct audience. To define your lists, start with the objective of your email. Are you creating a cross-selling campaign? Offering a promotion to some of your newest customers? Creating a loyalty program for your customers who have been with you since day one? No matter what the goal of your campaign is, segmenting your current contact database will help you determine how many email sets you will need and help tailor the content accordingly. Defining your audience into smaller subsets helps personalize your emails and provide more value to your customer, thus increasing the chances of your message being received and acted upon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Personalization</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Personalized emails can go a long way. Especially when considering the average email user will send and receive over 121 business emails a day (<a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-many-emails-does-the-average-person-receive-per-day/\"><span>Campaign Monitor</span></a>). Using personalization tokens in your email helps your message stand out to your audience by inserting information specific to each user in the content of your email. In fact, emails with personalized subject lines have a 26% higher open rate as well as deliver 6X higher transactional rates (<a href=\"https://www.liveclicker.com/21-compelling-email-marketing-and-personalization-stats-you-need-to-know-now/\"><span>LiveClicker</span></a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that personalization tokens are more than just first name and last name. Get creative with the information you have in your database. For example, if you were trying a cross-sell campaign, including the previous services/products purchased by your customer can help provide context to your email and correlate their previous experiences and your current offerings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Timing</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As any marketer can tell you, timing is a cornerstone of quality marketing messages. Determining when your customers are most active and likely to engage with your content is vital to the success of your campaign and messaging. Timing is not always straightforward either, it greatly varies depending on your medium and message. Additionally, timing cannot always be generalized and can change drastically according to your industry and audience’s behaviors. If you aren’t quite sure what timing best suits your audience, you can start by testing your email campaigns based on the time of day and the day of the week. By gathering this information over time, you will be able to carve out several prime times in which your marketing messages are best received. Remember, this can change over time, so it is essential to continually monitor your email analytics closely!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Mobile Friendliness</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will be hearing the words “mobile-friendliness” over and over and over again for the foreseeable future. That is due to rapid advancements in technology that have made our society more mobile than ever before. According to <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/8-effective-email-strategies-backed-by-research/\"><span>Buffer</span></a>, 47% of emails are opened on a mobile device. This means antiquated desktop-oriented content will become stretched or squeezed on the mobile platform and can even break certain content features such as calls to action (CTA’s). Therefore it is crucial to ensure your content is digestible and functional on mobile devices and desktops. Gone are the days of checking your email every morning on your desktop or laptop; with hybrid workers commuting back and forth, a large portion of your audience may only be able to catch up on their inbox on the go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Customer-Centric Content</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While this may seem like a no-brainer, there is alot more to creating customer-centric content than you may think.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Keep it Super Simple: Do not overwhelm your customer with overcomplicated content. Remember, you are competing against 151 other emails filtering in and out of your customer’s inbox. Keep your messaging simple and to the point, without any distractionary language. A general rule of thumb is to keep your content to a 5th-grade reading level. The easier information is to digest, the easier it is to act upon.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Utilize Compelling Messaging: While it is important to keep things short, it is also important to make sure they are sweet. Avoid generic messaging; instead, deliver relevant messaging as quickly as possible. Give your customer an engaging message that will compel them to continue reading or click through to an offer within thirty seconds of opening an email. Establish value early on, and your future message will carry even more weight.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Specific and Relevant CTA’s: Your CTA or call to action is essentially the objective of your messaging. It is the action you want your customer to take, whether it be a product trial, a limited-time sale, or a free “insert your industry’s verb here” you want to be clear with your CTA and provide instant value to your customer. Again avoid generic language and use the verbiage on your CTA to compel your customer to take action.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Informative and Compelling Landing Pages: In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web (<a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/\"><span>Unbounce</span></a>). In other words, it is the next destination your customer will visit after acting upon the content in your email. Much like your email’s messaging, it is essential to keep your landing page targeted and relevant to your customers’ needs. With that being said, if your customer is visiting a landing page, they have a basic level of vested interest; therefore, you can use your landing page to expand upon the messaging in your email.

According to <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/8-effective-email-strategies-backed-by-research/\"><span>Buffer</span></a>, 47% of emails are opened on a mobile device. This means antiquated desktop-oriented content will become stretched or squeezed on the mobile platform and can even break certain content features such as calls to action (CTA’s). Therefore it is crucial to ensure your content is digestible and functional on mobile devices and desktops. Gone are the days of checking your email every morning on your desktop or laptop; with hybrid workers commuting back and forth, a large portion of your audience may only be able to catch up on their inbox on the go.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Customer-Centric Content</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While this may seem like a no-brainer, there is alot more to creating customer-centric content than you may think.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Keep it Super Simple: Do not overwhelm your customer with overcomplicated content. Remember, you are competing against 151 other emails filtering in and out of your customer’s inbox. Keep your messaging simple and to the point, without any distractionary language. A general rule of thumb is to keep your content to a 5th-grade reading level. The easier information is to digest, the easier it is to act upon.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Utilize Compelling Messaging: While it is important to keep things short, it is also important to make sure they are sweet. Avoid generic messaging; instead, deliver relevant messaging as quickly as possible. Give your customer an engaging message that will compel them to continue reading or click through to an offer within thirty seconds of opening an email. Establish value early on, and your future message will carry even more weight.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Specific and Relevant CTA’s: Your CTA or call to action is essentially the objective of your messaging. It is the action you want your customer to take, whether it be a product trial, a limited-time sale, or a free “insert your industry’s verb here” you want to be clear with your CTA and provide instant value to your customer. Again avoid generic language and use the verbiage on your CTA to compel your customer to take action.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Informative and Compelling Landing Pages: In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web (<a href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/\"><span>Unbounce</span></a>). In other words, it is the next destination your customer will visit after acting upon the content in your email. Much like your email’s messaging, it is essential to keep your landing page targeted and relevant to your customers’ needs. With that being said, if your customer is visiting a landing page, they have a basic level of vested interest; therefore, you can use your landing page to expand upon the messaging in your email. Do not be afraid to dive deeper into your product/service, as you will provide information important to your customer’s decision-making process.</li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Follow Up and Analysis: It is vitally important that you follow up with your customers. One-time emails can provide valuable information for limited-time sales or announcements of new products; however, Copper Chronicles states that follow-up emails can triple your reply rate. Continuing to build upon your previous marketing messages makes it substantially easier to build trust with your audience and will serve to further bolster the success of your future emails. Additionally, closely tracking your emails analytics (open rates, click-through rates, HTML click maps, top clicked links, top engaged contacts, deliverability results, time spent reading emails, etc.) will help you improve upon your marketing messages and help you better define a process to send highly effective emails to your specific customer base. It is essential to continuously analyze your results and use them to your advantage, using your customers’ feedback to tailor your content further to create the most engaging and relevant content for your audience.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Creating an engaging email campaign is no easy feat and requires alot of trial and error and A/B testing to truly determine what is best for your specific set of customers and prospects. However, it isn’t impossible to do, and by following these best practices, you will find that you can refine your previous messaging to suit your audiences’ needs better.

Segmentation is what helps focus your email content as well as ensure that the right information is going to the correct audience. To define your lists, start with the objective of your email. Are you creating a cross-selling campaign? Offering a promotion to some of your newest customers? Creating a loyalty program for your customers who have been with you since day one? No matter what the goal of your campaign is, segmenting your current contact database will help you determine how many email sets you will need and help tailor the content accordingly. Defining your audience into smaller subsets helps personalize your emails and provide more value to your customer, thus increasing the chances of your message being received and acted upon.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Personalization</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Personalized emails can go a long way. Especially when considering the average email user will send and receive over 121 business emails a day (<a href=\"https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/knowledge-base/how-many-emails-does-the-average-person-receive-per-day/\"><span>Campaign Monitor</span></a>). Using personalization tokens in your email helps your message stand out to your audience by inserting information specific to each user in the content of your email. In fact, emails with personalized subject lines have a 26% higher open rate as well as deliver 6X higher transactional rates (<a href=\"https://www.liveclicker.com/21-compelling-email-marketing-and-personalization-stats-you-need-to-know-now/\"><span>LiveClicker</span></a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that personalization tokens are more than just first name and last name. Get creative with the information you have in your database. For example, if you were trying a cross-sell campaign, including the previous services/products purchased by your customer can help provide context to your email and correlate their previous experiences and your current offerings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Timing</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As any marketer can tell you, timing is a cornerstone of quality marketing messages. Determining when your customers are most active and likely to engage with your content is vital to the success of your campaign and messaging. Timing is not always straightforward either, it greatly varies depending on your medium and message. Additionally, timing cannot always be generalized and can change drastically according to your industry and audience’s behaviors. If you aren’t quite sure what timing best suits your audience, you can start by testing your email campaigns based on the time of day and the day of the week. By gathering this information over time, you will be able to carve out several prime times in which your marketing messages are best received. Remember, this can change over time, so it is essential to continually monitor your email analytics closely!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Mobile Friendliness</span></h2>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will be hearing the words “mobile-friendliness” over and over and over again for the foreseeable future.

For example, the management fee for advertising and actual cost are combined; or unreasonable markups when utilizing sub-contractors for specialty projects.</p>\n<h2>Lack of transparency</h2>\n<p>If the agency you are using is still reporting with spreadsheets, Google Visual Studio, or any tool that is generated based on user input - RUN AWAY! The primary reason agencies go this route - fluffing the numbers. <br><br>Now, don’t get me wrong, there are times when spreadsheets are needed to merge data and analyze from various sources, but they must be able to show how they arrived at their conclusion.</p>\n<h2>Horrible follow up</h2>\n<p>No matter who you are working with, it’s nice when you feel like a top priority and you are not having to chase down answers.</p>\n<h2>Always working with someone different or no one at all</h2>\n<p>Speaking to a live person and getting stuck in the automated system is standard practice today. It’s horrible. Make sure the agency gives you the same amount of attention after signing the contract as they did during the sales process.</p>\n<h2>They don’t understand your industry</h2>\n<p>Digital marketing is not about a specific industry and if the agency has experience in the industry. It’s about understanding the pain points of the business owner, identifying the tools necessary to solve the problem, training, and maintenance. <br><br>Additionally, marketing has become a data-driven profession that no longer uses “gut feelings” to make a decision. Every interaction a web visitor makes can be tracked and targeted through strategic planning. Therefore, you need to focus on an agency's ability to analyze data, develop a plan, and execute - plus deliver results.</p>\n<h2>Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>As the managing partner of Art’s Cube, it really frustrates me because we get lumped into this bucket as well. But, I don’t blame business owners because I agree with them after reviewing countless proposals, reports, and invoices from various agencies. <br><br>Our goal is to change the industry by continuing to provide personalized experiences, high touches, and clear communication. Which ensures both of our businesses succeed. <br><br></p>","publish_immediately":false,"use_featured_image":true,"published_by_id":5333144,"published_at":1650574223090,"rss_body":"<p>Over the past decade, I’ve spoken with hundreds of business owners and decision-makers who do not trust marketing agencies.

Below I will share with you the 5 most common issues I notice on <a href=\"https://artscube.biz/core-services/web-design\"><span>small business websites</span></a> that are hurting their potential for business.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Mobile Optimization</span></h2>\n<p>Having a website that renders in a way that fits the size of the screen your visitor is using is absolutely critical. There are some beautiful websites you can visit on your computer but they are a nightmare to try to navigate on a phone or tablet. Things such as the size of a “Buy Now” button could make the customer abandon their visit if they are having trouble tapping it. Aside from visitor frustration, search engines will also penalize your search rankings for a website that is not properly optimized.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Broken Links or Images</span></h2>\n<p>Have you ever tried clicking on a menu item or call to action button only for the page to refresh, take you to a generic page or do absolutely nothing? What about visiting a page where you see a little icon with a little piece of paper where the image for a product should be? Both of these examples will either cause a visitor to give up on finding the information they want or in the worst case it will cause them to think your website (and ultimately your business) is not legitimate.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Slow Loading</span></h2>\n<p>I can still remember the days of dial-up internet and web pages taking what felt like days to render. We are spoiled today with the bandwidth speed that we surf the internet with but with that speed our expectations of page loading have also increased. Slow web pages are often loaded down large numbers of images, large file-size images, or tons of unused code. While you may notice these pages it is not as easy to find the culprit of the problem</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Typography</span></h2>\n<p>Every company wants to stand out on the internet and a few try to do this via the fonts and colors that they choose to use on their websites.&nbsp; With millions of fonts available on the internet using some pretty script fonts may feel appealing but from the visitors’ point of view, it is difficult to read.&nbsp; Along with the font having proper sizing of the font and making sure that the colors of the font have enough contrast with the background to be read easily. Think about looking at a stop sign, it is very easy to read the word stop with the red background and white letters but if you tried to use grey for the letters all of a sudden reading the word instantly becomes much more difficult.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Consistency&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p>Users of your website become accustomed to where they need to go to find specific information. It may be visiting the menu to go to a shopping page or clicking your logo to return to the homepage. These items make navigating around your site quick but if your layouts differ from page to page then visitors may become frustrated trying to find the information they desire. There are sites out there that even appear that completely different themes, branding standards, typography, etc. are different on certain pages compared to the homepage. At best visitors search to find the information they want and in the worst-case scenario visitors do not believe your site to be legitimate or someone they want to do business with.</p>\n<p>Most of these items are easy to fix but are often missed because most businesses do not meticulously visit their site visiting every page. There are some online tools to help with some but in the end, it comes down to someone truly taking a deep dive through your website as if they were a prospective customer trying to make a decision on you.</p>","publish_immediately":null,"use_featured_image":true},"meta_description":"Business owners can become overwhelmed when they are told that they have problems with their website.

While this has certainly made it easier for marketers to increase their penetration into their customers' daily lives, it has also significantly ramped up the competition for said attention.

This is where the trusty old pal email comes into play.

One of the best facets of email communication is the fact that it is a passive activity. Many people check their email multiple times a day while at the gym, while watching a movie, and oftentimes while they are on vacation or out of the office.

Items that are detrimental to the health of your site can be as obvious as broken images but most of the items that are hurting your search rankings are not as obvious. Items that we commonly run across that are not obvious to the website owner are mobile optimization, images with large file sizes, and unused code. Some of these items can be fixed quickly but others can take hours (very tedious).&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Where do you start?</span></h2>\n<p>Giving your website a checkup is very easy and there are a plethora of tools available to help. There are free tools such as <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\"><span>Google’s Page Speed Insights</span></a> and paid tools such as <a href=\"https://seranking.com/\"><span>SE Ranking</span></a>, each look at different depths of your website. When it comes to what tool you should use, we live by the quote of “You get what you pay for”. Most free tools will give you some information but may not lead you to what you need to fix exactly.&nbsp; After getting your report you have to ask yourself do I know enough to be able to fix this or do I need help.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<script defer=\"defer\" data-widget-page-audit-id=\"200939\" src=\"https://online.seranking.com/skin/js/widget.js\">&nbsp;</script>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you decide to make the fixes to your website yourself, remember to check the health of your site again in a month or two since there will be updates made to your site along with changes to search engine algorithms that will change the importance of fixes to your website.
